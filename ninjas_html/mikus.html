                <p class="ninja__p"><span class="bold">MikuZ</span> is a skilled and formidable cyberpunk ninja who uses his expertise with katanas to protect his city from danger. Despite his small stature and round appearance, he is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, thanks to his quick reflexes and unmatched skill with the blade.</p>
                <p class="ninja__p">MikuZ was born and raised in the bustling metropolis of Wyszkow, a city known for its advanced technology and skilled ninjas. From a young age, he showed a fascination with weapons and spent hours every day practicing with his katanas.</p>
                <p class="ninja__p">As he grew older, MikuZ dedicated himself to mastering the art of the sword and became one of the most skilled and respected ninjas in the city. Despite his small size and unconventional appearance, he is feared by his enemies and admired by his fellow ninjas for his impressive skills and unrelenting determination.</p>
                <p class="ninja__p">MikuZ is fiercely loyal to his city and its people, and he will stop at nothing to protect them from danger and corruption. He has taken on some of the city's most powerful criminal organizations and always comes out on top, thanks to his lightning-fast reflexes and precise strikes with his katanas.</p>
                <p class="ninja__p">When he's not on the battlefield, MikuZ can often be found training with his katanas or hanging out with his fellow ninjas. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for his friends and will do anything to protect them.</p>
                <p class="ninja__p">Despite his many accomplishments, MikuZ still has his share of challenges and enemies. There are those in the city who resent his success and power, and he must always be on guard against those who would seek to harm him or his city.</p>
                <p class="ninja__p">But MikuZ is nothing if not resilient. He takes on every challenge with a fierce determination and a love for the thrill of the fight. He may be small and round, but he packs a punch, and his katanas are always at the ready to slice through any threat to his city.</p>
                <p class="ninja__p">So if you're ever in trouble in Wyszkow and need a skilled and reliable ninja on your side, don't hesitate to call on MikuZ.</p>
